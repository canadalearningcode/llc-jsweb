## Workshop Overview

### Description

In this workshop, learner will get started with the basics of using JavaScript in the context of the web. Learners will set up a development environment as well as be introduced to and apply basic JavaScript syntax and concepts through a series of exercises. They will then be guided in their exploration of a web page's the document object model (DOM) and how to use the methods of the `document` object to select and modify elements on a web page. 

### Learning objectives

By the end of this experience, learners will be able to:
1. __Work with JavaScript objects__, including using dot notation and applying built-in objects and methods in common use cases.
2. __Use selectors__ to find specific elements in a web page's document object model.
3. __Modify the content and visual presentation of a webpage__ through modifying elements with the document object model.
