JavaScript for the Web

## Summary

Javascript is a powerful language used to create interactive web and mobile applications.

## Description

JavaScript is one of the most common languages used to create experiences on the web, from simple animations to complex web applications. Used on _over 95% of all websites_, JavaScript is both highly relevant and easy to get started with, requiring only a text editor and a web browser.
This workshop is designed to be a hands-on experience for learning JavaScript. During the session, youâ€™ll learn:
* Basic JavaScript programming concepts, patterns, and syntax.
* How to use tools built into your browser to explore and debug JavaScript code.
* Where JavaScript fits in with other coding languages for the web such as HTML and CSS.
* How to modify the structure and content of a webpage, via its document object model (DOM), using JavaScript.
